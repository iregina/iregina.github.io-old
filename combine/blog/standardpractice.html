     Today's post will be about the standard practices of web design, Reset CSS, Normalize CSS, and HTML5.
    </p>
    <p> <strong>Web Design:</strong>
    	<p>
        The following are a list of standard practices in web designs:
        <ul>
        	<li>Always add a DOCTYPE to the top of the page before the opening html tag to help browsers intepret your document and figure out whether the page is written in HTML, XHTML, or both. </li>
        	<li>Avoid using inline styles and reference styles in the stylesheets</li>
        	<li>Add stylesheet links within the head tag, even though you can place them anywhere. Yahoo discovered that placing stylesheets in the head section of the document caused the page to load faster.</li>
        	<li>Always place javascript files at the bottom of the page just before the closing body tag, so that pages can load faster.</li>
        	<li>Never insert inline javascript. Place all javascript commands on an external file.</li>
        	<li>Validate your code frequently.</li>
        	<li>Keep all tags in lowercase.</li>
        	<li>Header tags may have some influence over your SEO rankings, as well as the user experience.</li>
        	<li>For blog posts, save H1 tag for blog titles</li>
        	<li>Wrap navigation in an unordered list</li>
        	<li>Always fill out an "Alt" attribute for images</li>
        </ul>

    </p>

        <b>What is Reset CSS?</b>

        	<p>CSS Reset is a short CSS script that resets the styles of all HTML elements. The reason people use this is because every browser applies it own 'user agent' stylesheet to websites. And web designers would like to ensure that their websites look the same across every browser, and the CSS Reset enables developers to reduce the likelihood of cross-browser differences. Some developers don't like using the CSS reset because it adds more effort and processing. Some developers also don't like CSS reset because cetain CSS reset codes can sometimes overirde your base styles. It's important that when you use CSS Reset to modify it a bit, rather than just paste it in without unedited.</p>
     </p>
 	<p>
        <b>What is the DRY Principle?</b>
        <p>Don't Repeat Yourself  (DRY) is a principle in software engingeering that applies well to multi-tier architectures like CSS and HTML. The principle's main point is that information should not be repeated. The opposite of DRY principle is the WET principle (We Enjoy Typing or Write Everything Twice).
        </p>
     </p>
    <p>
        <b>What is the Normalize CSS?</b>
        <p>An altnernative to CSS Reset is Normalize CSS. Like CSS Reset, it's a small CSS file that enables consistency in styling of HTML elements across various browsers. Normalize is a great alternative to Reset because it preserves some of the useful browser styles so that web developers don't have to start all the way from scratch. Normalize also fixes some common bugs that resets can't fix. Normalize also doesn't clutter debugging tools.

         <p>
        <b>What is HTML5?</b>
        <p>
        	HTML is the latest version of HTML and Web app technologies. One of the biggest part of HTML5 is sectioning content (section, article, aside, nav), which is the new way to create outlines for a webpage in addition to using heading content (h1 to h6). Typically, when an outline is created using heading content, the outline consists of implied sections. "Nav" and "Aside" work exactly the same as "section" and "article", but there's no requirement for headings for "nav" and "aside". 
        </p>
     </p>
     <p>
        <b>What is the Document Outlining Algorithm?</b>
        <p>
        	The Document Outlining Algorithm is a mechanism for producing outline summaries of Web pages based on how they are marked up. When sectioning content is used, the sections creates the outline and each explicit section has its own heading structure. Explicit sections can't go inside implicit sections, but implicit sections can go inside explitic sections. If you have secondary content that is generally related to your website — say, horse-training tips and industry news — you would mark it up as an aside, which creates an explicit section in the document outline. Similarly, major navigation would be marked up as nav, again creating an explicit section. Sectioning content elements are always considered subsections of their nearest ancestor sectioning root or their nearest ancestor element of sectioning content, whichever is nearest, regardless of what implied sections other headings may have created. Examples of section root elements are body, blockquote, details, fieldset, figure, and td. the first heading in the document that is not inside sectioning content is considered to be the document title.
