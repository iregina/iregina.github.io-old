     To commemorate my first week of DevBootcamp, I am going to talk about Git and GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the main concepts to mention when discussing Git and Github is version control. Version Control is a system of recording changes made to a project or file. It's an amazing way to move back and forth between various versions of a project. This is a huge lifesaver in times when you implement a change resulting in an unfixable bug and you need to go back to the previous state. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Git is a type of version control system. Git helps you keep track of changes as you are working on a file or project. When you input Git commands during your work, you are essentially take snapshots of all the changes you made during that time and it stores the changes you made into a local repository. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Github is a tool that lets multiple people using Git work on the same project. It keeps track of changes made across multiple repositories and enforces a push-and-pull check system for approving changes made to a project. In both Git and Github, there is an opportunity for the project creator to see details on what changes happened, where it happened, when it happened, and who caused it to happen.
