     This is third week of devbootcamp and I'm excited to say that I've built my first website. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It was defintely something that I was totally into because I could work on this website for hours without stopping - I was experiencing "the flow" and it was awesome.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm kind of surprised that I've never come across a github.io website prior to DBC before, but now I've been encouraging my sister and boyfriend to get once. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There are and still are a lot of challenges that I have to face as I maintain and update this site. The largest one that I could think of is a bit obvious if you just expand this window to a smaller size -- my site is not responsive. And I know this is an uphill battle that will take a bit of time and patience to get right. I also realize that my site has not incoporated any javascript and there's still something super dead and skeletal about the way my site feels -- that I want to change. My boyfriend (a designer) also said that I should change my social media buttons. They look fine to me -- but I guess I don't have that designer eye to notice that now. 
      </p>
       <p>
        I honestly love websign right now. I love the instant gratifications of seeing your changes. I love how there are so many resources online -- it's like a puzzle that can be solved with the right amount of patience. It would be amazing if I could build website as my future job. It's just so much fun!
