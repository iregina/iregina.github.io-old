    <p> <strong>What are arrays and hashes? And what are the differences between them?</strong>
    	<p>
        Arrays and Hashes serve similar functions and similar methods can apply to them.
    </p>
    <p>According to Ruby-Docs, <b>Arrays</b> are "ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object." In others, within an array, indexing starts a 0 and then goes upwards 1, 2, 3.. until the last object. Negative indexes start from the end of the array. 
        </p>
	<p>
		<b>Hashes</b> is a collection of "key-value" pairs. Rather than numbers that start at 0, its indexing does not go in a specific order and each object's index is assigned a "key" name. When you are trying to access a key in a hash, but it doesn't exists - hases will return "nil."
	</p>
	<p>
		The main difference between hashes and arrays lies in its indexing -- and that is the main determiner for deciding which of the two to use. For example, if you need to a collection to describe test scores of an exam, you can use arrays for determine the average score of the exam. However, if you want to identify the exam takers who scored the highest and lowest grade, a hash may be more useful because you assign a specific name to a score. One thing to keep in mind in regards to hashes is that two keys can have the value but two values cannnot have the same keys.
