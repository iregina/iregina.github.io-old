What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I learned that all HTML elements are essentially laid out in boxes (which can be seen if we add a border to everything). And everything has boxes wrapped around them. 

Padding = area around the content (also a box)
Border = box that goes around padding and content
Margin = the area outside the border (box)

What did you learn about CSS positioning?
It's important to specify exactly how you want each of your html elements to look on the page, and that includes how it's positioned on the page. 
There are four different positions for every element (static, relative, fixed, absolute) By default, all HTML elements are static. They are kind of in the middle, just based on the page looks. Relative position means that it is will be positioned rejative to its normal position.Fixed means it'll stay int he same place even if the page is scrolled. Relatie means that it's positioned according to the nearest positioned ancestor. 

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult? The easiest asepct was changing the font. It was pretty straightforward and I had no difficulties getting it to work. 
The asepcts of design most difficult to implement were my header links. They just weren't moving to where I wanted them to go, and I was having a difficult time getting them to move to the right place. 

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge? 
I learned that everything is connected and that I have to mindful of everything I write. Sometimes there are overlapping css elements. I never thought about concepts like specifying, cascading, and inheritance. It's also important to be careful to specify where your CSS file are located and link them carefully.
